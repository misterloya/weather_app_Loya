# weather_app_Loya

This weather app is made to give the user a 5 day lookout on weather. I utilized a free API to pull down data based on the search input information. 
This was a great excersize in using APIs and CSS in a functionally sound manner. Once the user clicks on submit after inputing a city, then information will 
present on the screen that includes a 5 days forecast.
