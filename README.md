# Loya Weather Dashboard

This weather app is made to give the user a 5 day lookout on weather. I utilized a free API to pull down data based on the search input information. 
This was a great excersize in using APIs and CSS in a functionally sound manner. Once the user clicks on submit after inputing a city, then information will 
present on the screen that includes a 5 days forecast. Icons were also used to enhance the design, as the API i utilized to pull weather information included them. 

Dynamically creating elements in HTML, in the browswer was the best part about making this website. I think being able to create elements via javascript really adds to the 
ability to interact with a website from a user's standpoint.
